# latexbot

The latexbot is small Web application which renders the provided LaTeX source as
an image. Currently only short (one line) snippets are supported. The output is
either the image itself or a link to the image containing rendered LaTeX source.
The output type can be specified in two ways:

* `OUTPUT_MODE` in `latexbot.cfg`, default value: link
* `mode` request argument, values: link or image
If `mode` is not provided, the value from `latexbot.cfg` is used.

Rendered images are written to `/tmp` and can be downloaded until `/tmp` is
flushed.

In cases where exceptions are caught, an entry of them is printed to `stderr`.

## Running
There are (at least) two ways to run this application:

* Using a Docker container. This way is not recommended as the image is big,
approximately 1.1 GB. The only benefit is that a LaTeX (Tex Live) distribution is
included in the image.
* Using a WSGI server. This is the preferred alternative. Basically any WSGI
compatible is okay. _Important_ note about _dependencies_: a LaTeX distribution needs
to be available. Tex Live 2014 and later are known to work. An example with the
Gunicorn WSGI server: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5001 -w 2 latexbot:app`.
